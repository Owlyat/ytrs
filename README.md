[MPV](https://mpv.io/installation/) needs to be installed.
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) / [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) automatically install (in the current working directory, a 'libs' directory will be created and a 'output' directory will be created when you'll use yt-dlp).
You might also want [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for Summarizing Transcripts.

To run the app:
```
cargo build --release
```
